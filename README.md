# Rotary Inverted Pendulum Control Systems

## Overview

Welcome to the Rotary Inverted Pendulum Control Systems project! This project explores the implementation and comparison of three different control strategies—PID, LQR, and RL—applied to a rotary inverted pendulum system.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alirezarezaeei78/rotary-inverted-pendulum.git
    cd rotary-inverted-pendulum
    ```

2. **Install Required Packages**: Install the required Python packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set Up MuJoCo**: Ensure you have MuJoCo installed and properly set up on your system. You may need to obtain a MuJoCo license and follow the installation instructions provided on the [MuJoCo website](http://www.mujoco.org/).

4. **Run the Controllers**: Navigate to the respective directories and run the provided scripts to see the controllers in action.

    - PID Controller:
      ```bash
      cd Rotary_Inverted_Pendulum_PID
      python Rotary_Inverted_Pendulum_PID.py
      ```

    - LQR Controller:
      ```bash
      cd Rotary_Inverted_Pendulum_LQR
      python Rotary_Inverted_Pendulum_LQR.py
      ```

    - RL Controller:
      ```bash
      cd Rotary_Inverted_Pendulum_RL
      python Rotary_Inverted_Pendulum_RL.py
      ```

5. **View Results**: Explore the results, plots, and videos in their respective directories to analyze the performance of each control strategy.
